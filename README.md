### Blagotube!

That's the name I decided to give this project (based on [this comic](https://xkcd.com/181/)).

This repository is the source code for [my website](http://ja.meswebber.com), which is a blog primarily focused on the topic of building itself. Because of the way [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com) works, this code isn't hosted in the GitHub pages repository for the site&mdash;that just contains the compiled static version.

The main appeal of this repository is that it contains my Lektor-plugin-adaptation of [Glasseye](http://coppeliamla.github.io/glasseye/glasseye_markdownExample/demo.html), a nice little tool for combining Markdown, Tufte CSS, and d3.js in one website. I've modified Simon's code to implement fancier sidenotes and some other tweaks.
