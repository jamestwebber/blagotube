## Hi, I'm James

### About me

I'm a graduate student in the [bioinformatics](http://bioinformatics.ucsf.edu) program at [UCSF](http://www.ucsf.edu). I'm a joint student in the [Bandyopadhyay](http://www.cancersignaling.net) and [Krogan](http://kroganlab.ucsf.edu) labs.

I decided I should make a blog because tweets are too short to say some things. We'll see how it goes.

Just now I realized I'm about to give a lot of people at [PMWC](http://www.pmwcintl.com/2017sv/)<sidenote>Hi there, PMWC people. I wrote a post [about that card](blog/the-best-card).</sidenote> a link to this website and I should probably add some Premium Content&trade;. Or at least [my CV](/CV).

### Some links

* I'm on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/james_t_webber), as I previously mentioned. If you think this website is way too long and/or lacking in cat GIFs, you can go there.
* I'm also on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/jamestwebber), although not as much as I should be.
* I have an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8594-9888). I'm not totally sure what I'm doing with it but I fervently believe it's worth having.

### Some projects

I've made some random projects in my copious free time.

* This site is (as of [today](/blog/first-post/)) built using [Lektor](http://www.getlektor.com) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The code is hosted [here](https://github.com/jamestwebber/jamestwebber.github.io) if you're really curious.<sidenote>Actually that's not really the code at all&mdash;it's the static website that gets generated by Lektor. The real code is [here](https://github.com/jamestwebber/blagotube).</sidenote>
* [Revealed-d3](https://github.com/jamestwebber/revealed3-blank) is a blank template for presentations that use [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) and [d3.js](https://d3js.org/). It's pretty simple but I find it useful.
* [Frameshift](http://frameshift.herokuapp.com) is currently down, but When it was up, it was an A/B voting site to decide what glasses I should order from [Warby Parker](http://www.warbyparker.com).
    * I'll fix it someday. Maybe even upgrade it? And put it on GitHub.
