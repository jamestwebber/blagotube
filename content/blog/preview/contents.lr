I made this blog because some stuff doesn't fit in a tweet, so I should probably write something, huh? Here are the main things I want to write, eventually:

 * Something about publishing
 * Something about graduate education
 * Something about the research enterprise in general
 * (Maybe) something about statistics

If I ever write these posts, I'll update this one to reflect that.
